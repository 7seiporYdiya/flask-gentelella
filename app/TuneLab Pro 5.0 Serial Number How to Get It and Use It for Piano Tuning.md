# TuneLab Pro 5.0: A Professional Piano Tuning Tool for Windows
 
TuneLab Pro 5.0 is a software application that turns any Windows laptop or tablet computer into a full-featured high-quality electronic tuning device for pianos. It is designed by Real-Time Specialties, a company that specializes in piano tuning software and hardware. TuneLab Pro 5.0 has many features that make it a powerful and reliable tool for professional piano tuners, such as:
 
- Two forms of pitch display: a phase display that shows how the note compares with its ideal pitch using squares that move to the left or right, and a spectrum display that shows the distribution of audio energy across the frequency spectrum.
- Automatic note switching: the program detects the note that is being played and switches to it automatically, saving time and avoiding errors.
- Pitch-raise mode: the program can adjust the pitch of the entire piano by a specified amount, making it easier to tune pianos that are very flat or sharp.
- Inharmonicity measurement: the program can measure the inharmonicity of each string, which is the deviation of its partials from their ideal harmonic ratios. This allows the tuner to create custom tuning curves that match the characteristics of each piano.

To use TuneLab Pro 5.0, the tuner needs a Windows laptop or tablet computer with a microphone input, a microphone or pickup device that can be attached to the piano, and a license key that can be purchased from the Real-Time Specialties website[^6^]. The license key is valid for one computer only and cannot be transferred to another device. The program can be downloaded for free from the website[^6^] and used for a trial period of 30 days. After that, the program will stop working unless a valid license key is entered.

In this article, we will show you how to use TuneLab Pro 5.0 to tune a piano in a few simple steps. Before you start, make sure you have the following items ready:

1. A Windows laptop or tablet computer with a microphone input and TuneLab Pro 5.0 installed.
2. A microphone or pickup device that can be attached to the piano. You can use any type of microphone that can capture the sound of the piano, such as a clip-on microphone, a contact microphone, or a condenser microphone. Alternatively, you can use a pickup device that attaches to the tuning pins or the soundboard of the piano and converts the vibrations into electrical signals.
3. A license key for TuneLab Pro 5.0 that you have purchased from the Real-Time Specialties website. You will need to enter this key when you run the program for the first time.

Once you have everything ready, follow these steps to tune your piano with TuneLab Pro 5.0:

1. Connect your microphone or pickup device to your computer and place it near the piano. Make sure it can pick up the sound of all the strings clearly and without interference from other sources of noise.
2. Run TuneLab Pro 5.0 on your computer and enter your license key if prompted. You will see the main window of the program with two displays: the phase display on the left and the spectrum display on the right.
3. Select the tuning mode that suits your needs. You can choose from three modes: Equal Temperament, Stretch Tuning, or Custom Tuning. Equal Temperament is the standard tuning system that divides the octave into 12 equal semitones. Stretch Tuning is a variation of Equal Temperament that slightly sharpens or flattens some notes to compensate for the inharmonicity of the strings. Custom Tuning allows you to create your own tuning curve based on the measured inharmonicity of each string.
4. If you choose Custom Tuning, you will need to measure the inharmonicity of each string first. To do this, select Measure Inharmonicity from the Tools menu and follow the instructions on the screen. You will need to play each note on the piano and wait for TuneLab Pro 5.0 to analyze its spectrum and calculate its inharmonicity coefficient. This process may take some time depending on the size and condition of your piano.
5. After you have selected or created your tuning curve, you can start tuning your piano. Start from the middle octave (A3 to A4) and work your way up and down. Play each note on the piano and watch the phase display. The phase display shows how far off each note is from its ideal pitch using squares that move to the left or right. The goal is to make each square stop in the center of the display by adjusting the tuning pin of each string with a tuning hammer. You can also use the spectrum display to check the harmonic structure of each note and fine-tune it by ear.
6. If your piano is very flat or sharp, you may need to do a pitch-raise first before tuning it precisely. To do this, select Pitch-Raise Mode from the Options menu and enter how much you want to raise or lower the pitch of the entire piano (in cents). Then follow step 5 but tune each note roughly instead of precisely. After you have done a pitch-raise, switch back to Normal Mode and tune each note again with more accuracy.

Congratulations! You have successfully tuned your piano with TuneLab Pro 5.0. You can now enjoy playing your piano with improved sound quality and harmony.
