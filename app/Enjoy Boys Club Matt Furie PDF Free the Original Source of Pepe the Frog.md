Pepe the Frog is a cultural icon and deserves to be reclaimed from the alt-right. This book is a must-read for anyone who enjoys absurd humor and psychedelic art." - 5 stars

> "I don't get the appeal of this book. It's just a bunch of gross-out jokes and drug references that are not funny at all. The art is ugly and sloppy, and the characters are annoying and stupid. Pepe the Frog is a symbol of hate and should be banned. This book is a waste of time and money." - 1 star
